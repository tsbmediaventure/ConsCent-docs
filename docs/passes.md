## Working with passes

You can use the pass system to allow unrestricted access to your premium content for a limited amount of time (from 1 hour upto 14 days).

You can create multiple passes that are active at certain times of the week, e.g. you can have a weekend pass with a different price on the weekends and a day pass on the weekdays.

To create a pass, please go to the manage passes page in the integration section of your client dashboard

### Technical details
