## Working with passes

You can use the pass system to allow unrestricted access to your premium content for a limited amount of time (from 1 hour upto 14 days).

You can create multiple passes that are active at certain times of the week, e.g. you can have a weekend pass with a different price on the weekends and a day pass on the weekdays.
To do this, set start day/end day on your passes to control their availability.

To create a pass, please go to the manage passes page in the integration section of your client dashboard

### Technical details

You can skip any CMS / Backend related steps written in the [integration page.](integration.md)

You only need to do the frontend-related steps to initalize the paywall.

Caveats:
**To make sure passes work, your blanket pricing default value must be a non-zero value**

**Daily passes do not work on AMP/iOS/Android at the moment**
