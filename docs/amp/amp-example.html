      Early use Scientists are still debating when people started wearing
      clothes. Estimates by various experts have ranged from 40,000 to 3 million
      years ago. Some more recent studies involving the evolution of body lice
      have implied a more recent development with some indicating a development
      of around 170,000 years ago and others indicating as little as 40,000. No
      single estimate is widely accepted.[1][2][3][4] Ralf Kittler, Manfred
      Kayser and Mark Stoneking, anthropologists at the Max Planck Institute for
      Evolutionary Anthropology, conducted a genetic analysis of human body lice
      that suggests clothing originated around 170,000 years ago. Body lice are
      an indicator of clothes-wearing, since most humans have sparse body hair,
      and lice thus require human clothing to survive. Their research suggests
      that the invention of clothing may have coincided with the northward
      migration of modern Homo sapiens away from the warm climate of Africa,
      thought to have begun between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. However, a
      second group of researchers using similar genetic methods estimate that
      clothing originated around 540,000 years ago.[5] According to
      archaeologists and anthropologists, the earliest clothing likely consisted
      of fur, leather, leaves, or grass that were draped, wrapped, or tied
      around the body. Knowledge of such clothing remains inferential, since
      clothing materials deteriorate quickly compared to stone, bone, shell and
      metal artifacts. Archeologists have identified very early sewing needles
      of bone and ivory from about 30,000 BC, found near Kostenki, Russia in
      1988.[6] Dyed flax fibers that could have been used in clothing have been
      found in a prehistoric cave in the Republic of Georgia that date back to
      34,000 BC.

        Making clothing See also: Garment industry, knitting, and weaving Sari
        Hindu Indian lady wearing sari, painting by Raja Ravi Varma. One of the
        most ancient and popular pieces of clothing in the Indian subcontinent
        Some human cultures, such as the various peoples of the Arctic Circle,
        traditionally make their clothing entirely of prepared and decorated
        furs and skins. Other cultures supplemented or replaced leather and
        skins with cloth: woven, knitted, or twined from various animal and
        vegetable fibers including wool, linen, cotton, silk, hemp, and ramie.
        Although modern consumers may take the production of clothing for
        granted, making fabric by hand is a tedious and labor-intensive process
        involving fiber making, spinning, and weaving. The textile industry was
        the first to be mechanized – with the powered loom – during the
        Industrial Revolution. Different cultures have evolved various ways of
        creating clothes out of cloth. One approach simply involves draping the
        cloth. Many people wore, and still wear, garments consisting of
        rectangles of cloth wrapped to fit – for example, the dhoti for men and
        the sari for women in the Indian subcontinent, the Scottish kilt and the
        Javanese sarong. The clothes may simply be tied up (dhoti and sari); or
        pins or belts hold the garments in place (kilt and sarong). The cloth
        remains uncut, and people of various sizes can wear the garment. Another
        approach involves measuring, cutting, and sewing the cloth by hand or
        with a sewing machine. Clothing can be cut from a sewing pattern and
        adjusted by a tailor to the wearer's measurements. An adjustable sewing
        mannequin or dress form is used to create form-fitting clothing. If the
        fabric is expensive, the tailor tries to use every bit of the cloth
        rectangle in constructing the clothing; perhaps cutting triangular
        pieces from one corner of the cloth, and adding them elsewhere as
        gussets. Traditional European patterns for men's shirts and women's
        chemises take this approach. These remnants can also be reused to make
        patchwork hats, vests, and skirts. Modern European fashion treats cloth
        much less conservatively, typically cutting in such a way as to leave
        various odd-shaped cloth remnants. Industrial sewing operations sell
        these as waste; home sewers may turn them into quilts. In the thousands
        of years that humans have been making clothing, they have created an
        astonishing array of styles, many of which have been reconstructed from
        surviving garments, photos, paintings, mosaics, etc., as well as from
        written descriptions. Costume history can inspire current fashion
        designers, as well as costumiers for plays, films, television, and
        historical reenactment. Functions A baby wearing many items of winter
        clothing: headband, cap, fur-lined coat, scarf and sweater Four types of
        women's clothing which end above the knees: (clockwise from top)
        minidress, miniskirt, shorts and romper, all worn by the same model The
        most obvious function of clothing is to protect the wearer from the
        elements. In hot weather, clothing provides protection from sunburn or
        wind damage. In the cold, it offers thermal insulation. Shelter can
        reduce the functional need for clothing. For example, coats, hats,
        gloves and other outer layers are normally removed when entering a warm
        place.
