      Early use Scientists are still debating when people started wearing
      clothes. Estimates by various experts have ranged from 40,000 to 3 million
      years ago. Some more recent studies involving the evolution of body lice
      have implied a more recent development with some indicating a development
      of around 170,000 years ago and others indicating as little as 40,000. No
      single estimate is widely accepted.[1][2][3][4] Ralf Kittler, Manfred
      Kayser and Mark Stoneking, anthropologists at the Max Planck Institute for
      Evolutionary Anthropology, conducted a genetic analysis of human body lice
      that suggests clothing originated around 170,000 years ago. Body lice are
      an indicator of clothes-wearing, since most humans have sparse body hair,
      and lice thus require human clothing to survive. Their research suggests
      that the invention of clothing may have coincided with the northward
      migration of modern Homo sapiens away from the warm climate of Africa,
      thought to have begun between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. However, a
      second group of researchers using similar genetic methods estimate that
      clothing originated around 540,000 years ago.[5] According to
      archaeologists and anthropologists, the earliest clothing likely consisted
      of fur, leather, leaves, or grass that were draped, wrapped, or tied
      around the body. Knowledge of such clothing remains inferential, since
      clothing materials deteriorate quickly compared to stone, bone, shell and
      metal artifacts. Archeologists have identified very early sewing needles
      of bone and ivory from about 30,000 BC, found near Kostenki, Russia in
      1988.[6] Dyed flax fibers that could have been used in clothing have been
      found in a prehistoric cave in the Republic of Georgia that date back to
      34,000 BC.
