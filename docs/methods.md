## Content Registration

Content registration method is the recommended method to integrate with ConsCent if you have sufficient control over your backend/CMS to make API calls to register content with ConsCent.

The steps involved in this flow are:

1. Registration: Each premium content you want to micro-price is registered with us via API calls.

2. Paywall Initialization: When user reaches premium content, the paywall is initialized based on the registered information

3. Validation & Unlocking: Upon payment, your website is notified and is responsible for showing the premium content.

#### Registration

#### Paywall Initialization

We completely replace the contents of an empty div, please pass the id of an empty div tag with nothin else in it, positioned wherever you require.
Pass the id of the div as wrappingElementId
#### Validation & Unlocking
