Content registration method is the recommended method to integrate with ConsCent if you have sufficient control over your backend/CMS to make API calls to register content with ConsCent.

The steps involved in this flow are:

1. Registration: Each premium content you want to micro-price is registered with us via API calls.

2. Paywall Initialization: When user reaches premium content, the paywall is initialized based on the registered information

3. Validation & Unlocking: Upon payment, your website is notified and is responsible for showing the premium content.
