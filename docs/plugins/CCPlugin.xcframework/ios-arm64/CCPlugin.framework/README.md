======================

This is a step by step guide to include Conscent Plugin in your app. This plugin is developed in Swift and supports IOS 13.0 and above.


###
Open project in Xcode. Let Xcode compile it, When project is compiled, hit build. After above process, the project is ready to use.
For generating new xcframework, go to terminal and type cd "\(path to IOS plugin folder on your desktop)" 
and 
paste the code in terminal and hit enter

xcodebuild archive \
-scheme CCPlugin \
-configuration Release \
-destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' \
-archivePath './build/CCPlugin.framework-iphonesimulator.xcarchive' \
SKIP_INSTALL=NO \
BUILD_LIBRARIES_FOR_DISTRIBUTION=YES

after you see archive succesfull
paste the code in terminal and hit enter

xcodebuild archive \
-scheme CCPlugin \
-configuration Release \
-destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \
-archivePath './build/CCPlugin.framework-iphoneos.xcarchive' \
SKIP_INSTALL=NO \
BUILD_LIBRARIES_FOR_DISTRIBUTION=YES

after you see archive succesfull
paste the code in terminal and hit enter

xcodebuild -create-xcframework \
-framework './build/CCPlugin.framework-iphonesimulator.xcarchive/Products/Library/Frameworks/CCPlugin.framework' \
-framework './build/CCPlugin.framework-iphoneos.xcarchive/Products/Library/Frameworks/CCPlugin.framework' \
-output './build/CCPlugin.xcframework'

Now go to IOS plugin folder and see the build folder, inside it you are going to see a folder named CCPlugin.xcframework that is your framework which you can drag and drop in your project.
